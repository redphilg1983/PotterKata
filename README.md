Build and run Applciation.

Using postman or something simlar, do a Get request against the API to get a copy of the JSON object you will use to post the number of books you are looking to purchase.

Copy the JSON object from the Get request.

Create a POST request to the same endpoint using the copied JSON object making sure that you update the number of each book you wish to get.

The best price should be returned.

I have setup the project using Mediatr on purpose as you would normally get the data from some sort of datasourece using the Await command on the data calls.
